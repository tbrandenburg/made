# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
Complete, production-ready AI agent system from the Dynamous AI Agent Mastery course (Module 8: Agent Evaluations). This is a comprehensive AI agent platform with advanced research capabilities, document processing, web search, and a complete evaluation framework for testing and monitoring agent quality in production.

**Key Innovation**: Full-stack AI agent with integrated evaluation framework including golden datasets, rule-based evaluators, LLM judges, and production monitoring through Langfuse. Demonstrates enterprise-grade AI agent development with proper testing, evaluation, and observability.

## Target Users
- Course participants learning production AI agent development
- Developers building enterprise AI agents with evaluation capabilities
- Teams needing comprehensive agent testing and monitoring
- Organizations deploying AI agents to production with quality assurance
- Developers learning modular AI system architecture

## Key Features
- **Intelligent AI Assistant**: Advanced research and analysis with memory, RAG, web search, and image analysis
- **Evaluation Framework**: Golden datasets, rule-based evaluators, LLM judges, and production monitoring
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate backend API, RAG pipeline, and React frontend
- **Production Ready**: Docker deployment, Langfuse observability, user feedback collection
- **Multi-Modal**: Text, image analysis, document processing, and web search capabilities
- **Scalable**: Independent component scaling and multiple deployment strategies

## Business Objectives
- Provide complete educational framework for AI agent development
- Demonstrate production-grade AI agent architecture and best practices
- Enable comprehensive agent evaluation and quality monitoring
- Show enterprise deployment patterns and scalability approaches
- Create reusable template for production AI agent systems

## User Journey
1. **Setup**: Deploy modular system (agent API, RAG pipeline, frontend) via Docker or cloud
2. **Document Ingestion**: RAG pipeline processes local files or Google Drive documents
3. **Agent Interaction**: Users chat with agent through React frontend with streaming responses
4. **Quality Monitoring**: Evaluation framework runs golden datasets and production monitoring
5. **Feedback Loop**: User ratings and Langfuse observability inform agent improvements

## Success Criteria
- Agent provides accurate, well-sourced responses using available tools
- Evaluation framework maintains >80% pass rate on golden datasets
- Production monitoring catches quality issues in real-time
- System scales across different deployment environments
- Course participants successfully deploy and extend the system
