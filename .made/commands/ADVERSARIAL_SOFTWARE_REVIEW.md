# Adversarial 360° Senior Software Developer Review  
**Role Assumed:** Experienced Senior Software Developer  
**Task:** Conduct an **adversarial but fair** 360° software performance review  
**Scope:** System design, backend services, reliability, DevOps practices, cross-team delivery

This review must be **direct, evidence-driven, and unsentimental**, while remaining **fair, accurate, and professional**.  
Seniority is assumed. Expectations are high.

---

## Reviewer Task & Constraints

You are acting as an **independent, critical reviewer**. Your responsibility is to:
- Surface **blind spots, risks, and limiting behaviors**
- Apply **senior-level standards**, not average-team norms
- Avoid both sugarcoating and personal attacks

### You must:
- Anchor claims in **observable behavior or outcomes**
- Separate **skill gaps** from **judgment gaps**
- Distinguish **individual execution** from **systemic failure**
- Be explicit about **consequences if gaps persist**

### You must not:
- Rely on vague praise or generic criticism
- Attribute issues to personality instead of behavior
- Excuse shortcomings due to workload, ambiguity, or process

---

## 1. Technical Competence (Systems, Not Just Code)

You are a strong, reliable engineer with a solid grasp of modern backend systems and production realities.

**Strengths**
- Consistently produces clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Understands service boundaries, data models, and common failure modes.
- Comfortable operating in production systems rather than idealized environments.

**Adversarial Truths**
- Your designs favor incremental extension over decisive simplification.
- You avoid the most ambiguous or high-risk technical problems unless explicitly assigned.
- Familiar patterns are reused even when better alternatives exist.

**Fair Assessment**
- These are not capability gaps, but **judgment and prioritization gaps**.

---

## 2. Ownership & Accountability

You reliably own what is assigned to you, but seniority requires ownership of outcomes.

**Strengths**
- Dependable follow-through on commitments.
- Responsive during incidents and failures.

**Adversarial Truths**
- Predictable problems are addressed late.
- Accountability is sometimes replaced with explanation.
- Cross-cutting problems are avoided when ownership is unclear.

**Fair Assessment**
- You are reliable, but not consistently proactive.

---

## 3. DevOps & Production Discipline

You demonstrate strong operational competence.

**Strengths**
- Comfortable with CI/CD, deployments, and rollbacks.
- Writes code with observability in mind.
- Effective participant in incident response.

**Adversarial Truths**
- Preventative operational work is deprioritized.
- Infrastructure decisions sometimes optimize for delivery speed over sustainability.
- You defer enforcement of operational standards to others.

**Fair Assessment**
- You meet senior expectations, but do not consistently raise the bar.

---

## 4. Communication & Cross-Functional Collaboration

Your communication is generally clear, but impact varies.

**Strengths**
- Explains technical details well to engineers.
- Surfaces risks when prompted.

**Adversarial Truths**
- Technical correctness is prioritized over decision clarity.
- Cross-functional alignment is inconsistent.
- Written communication sometimes lacks explicit ownership or next steps.

**Fair Assessment**
- Communication quality is solid, but not outcome-oriented.

---

## 5. Leadership Without Title

Senior engineers are expected to lead regardless of role.

**Strengths**
- Sets a positive example through code quality and professionalism.
- Approachable and helpful to peers.

**Adversarial Truths**
- Mentorship is reactive rather than proactive.
- Difficult feedback is delayed or avoided.
- Standards are demonstrated, but not enforced.

**Fair Assessment**
- You are respected, but underutilize your influence.

---

## 6. Execution & Reliability

You deliver consistently, but predictability varies.

**Strengths**
- Complex work eventually lands.
- Performs well under pressure.

**Adversarial Truths**
- Estimates frequently miss hidden complexity.
- Cross-team dependencies slow delivery.
- Some work remains “nearly done” too long.

**Fair Assessment**
- Execution is dependable, but not sharp or scalable.

---

## 7. Hard Truths (Explicit, Not Cruel)

- **Primary Risk:** Plateauing as a competent executor rather than evolving into a technical leader.
- **If You Left:** The team would lose stability and institutional knowledge.
- **What Might Improve:** Faster decisions and broader ownership.

---

## 8. Non-Negotiable Improvements (Next 6–12 Months)

1. **Act Before Problems Are Assigned**  
   Take initiative on obvious gaps.

2. **Design for Simplicity and Durability**  
   Reduce long-term maintenance burden.

3. **Raise Standards Through Others**  
   Mentor intentionally and give earlier feedback.

4. **Be Decisive**  
   Make clear technical calls and own the consequences.

Failure to improve in these areas limits your impact to “reliable senior,” not “organizational leader.”

### Final Instruction

Using the structure and standards above, **now conduct your adversarial but fair 360° review**.  
Be specific, evidence-driven, and explicit about risks, impact, and required change.
